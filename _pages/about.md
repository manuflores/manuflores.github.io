Hey, hola, hallo! I'm Manu, a grad student in Matt Thomson's group at Caltech, a greenhouse for exploring bold ideas in math & biology. 

### Research interests

I'm broadly interested in using mathematics and computation to answer questions in genomics, evolution, and development. 

These days I'm mostly interested in the following topics.  

* Development and regeneration: 
  * How does a single cell self-organize to develop into a complex organism like an animal ? 
  * What are the common features of development and regeneration ? 

I guide the answer to these questions using the following mathematical methods. 

* Applied and Numerical Linear algebra 
* Differential Geometry 
* Matrix groups 
* Topology
